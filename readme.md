# (-_-) House Price Prediction Project

This project uses **Machine Learning (Linear Regression)** to predict house prices based on features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, and parking spaces.

---

## - About the Project

- **Goal:** Predict the price of a house using data features.
- **Algorithm Used:** Linear Regression
- **Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- **Dataset:** Custom CSV file (`house_prices.csv`)

## - Concepts Learned

- Data loading and exploration using Pandas  
- Train-test split and model training  
- Evaluating performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² Score  
- Making predictions on new data
